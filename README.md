# jpypackage

Utility functions and miscellaneous code chunks for Python workflows and work-related stuff. Functions and classes are liable to be changed/deprecated at any time. Useful functions will likely make their way into other packages, at which point they will be made more robust through testing etc. and become more stable over time.
